Create your own tip calculator that automatically updates labels based on the user's input. This is just the User Interface for the app, 
follow along on my youtube channel for the code: https://youtu.be/7-rd5W_EPzw . To create the app click on clone and download the project. 
Once downloaded you can open the project in Xcode and you are good to go.

Please note that the app is targeted for IOS devices running IOS 13 or higher. I used Xcode 12 and the code is written in Swift 5.
